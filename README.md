# Descriptions of code:

### colour_TPM_using_bed.js
Description: Used to load divergent colourmap for visualizing strand-specific transcription levels in 3D space using CSynth GUI.

### sim_HiC_map_CSynth.m
Description: Used to simulate Hi-C contact map from CSynth structure. Compare this to original Hi-C map for an assessment of CSynth accuracy.

%Fig S3 A & G in paper

### RNAseq_align_to_CSynth_agg_chr.m
Description: Spatial patterns of active transcription determined by mapping RNA-seq data to 3D position on CSynth structure. An aggregate analysis is done where chromosomes are isotropically scaled to the same size, and integrated in cylindrical coordinates to show the average transcription level vs distance to centre/surface of the chromosome. Consider adding 1D line plot.

### Spatial_Nematic_Order.m
Description: Used to calculate alignment (nematic order parameter) of tangent vectors to DNA that are in close spatial proximity.

### TAD_analysis.m

Description:

%Fig 4 D,E,F in paper:
%D) Active gene density is not correlated with TAD asphericity. 
%E) Transcription magnitude (transcripts per million) is not correlated with TAD asphericity.
%F) The length of active gene arrays is not correlated with TAD asphericity.

### convert_hic_to_CSynth.py
Description: A way to directly convert .hic formatted Hi-C data to a format accepted by CSynth.

### CSynth_FISH_Compare_Su_Cell_2020.m
Description: Use to assess accuracy of CSynth conformations and to optomize CSynth parameters, using a human cell line where HiC data and 3D FISH data (652 probes) exists.
% Fig S3 C,D,E,F in paper

### fractal_equilbrium_load.m
Description: Used to compute contact probability "P(s)" curves from fractal and equilibrium globule conformations as a positive control for the calculation.

### iter_Cholesteric_HiC.m
Description: Generate cholesteric polymer model with extra chromosomal loops. Vary loop length, number of discs, cholesteric pitch, and other model parameters. Compute cholesteric HiC matrix and contact probability curves.

### constrained_RW_1D.m
Description: Function used to generate extrachromosomal loops. Random walks are generated separately for each of the spatial three dimensions.

### constrained_self_avoiding_RW_3D.m
Description: Function used to generate extrachromosomal loops. Combines random walks in each dimension to compute a 3D random walk. 

### contact_probability_xyz.m
Description: Function used to compute contact probability "P(s)" curves from a 3D structure. Calculation is different from computing contact probability curve from HiC matrix.

### Orientation_Order_Parameter.py
Description: Used to compute the correlation between two tangent vectors to the 3D chromosome structure separated by a certain primary sequence length, averaged over the entire chromosome.

### plot_P(s)_dinoflagellate.py
Description: Used to compute the contact probability "P(s)" curves for dinoflagellate HiC data testing affect of chromosome ordering (chrom_length_order.py) and differences in aseembly (Smic1.0 vs Smic1.1N).

### Fig3_A_CLC_Expression.m
Description: code to create 3D visual model of surface-localized gene expression on CLC chromosomes using a divergent strand-specific expression colormap

### chr_coverage_at_various_TPM.m
